                    <h3>They look great on TV</h3> 
                    <p>I had lived in St. Louis a year and half when I decided I needed a dog, even though I was worried
                        about the being woken up early with being licked in the face part that I had seen all dogs do on 
                        tv. I&#8217m from a very small town and never had any real pets before when I was younger. I had just 
                        moved in with my best friend Dani, as had her boyfriend, Dane, who had a male dog named Cali, 
                        while I saved for my first house. I had done my research on dogs of different breeds for a few 
                        months and thought I had the ideal dog in mind. I didn&#8217t want a puppy, especially with never 
                        having had a dog before. I didn&#8217t know how to train a dog! I wanted a dog that got along with 
                        other dogs, loved children, didn&#8217t chew up everything, didn&#8217t shed a lot, and was potty trained. 
                        That&#8217s when I decided I wanted a two-year old, potty trained, female Staffordshire Terrier, 
                        preferably a blue one. I had lived with my cousin who had a female Pitbull and she listened so 
                        well and loved her kids. I just knew that&#8217s what type of dog I wanted. So I started my quest to 
                        find the perfect dog. </p>

                    <h3> Looking for love</h3> 
                    <p> I found lots of dogs but none that even came close to my criteria. All the shelters I went to 
                        either the dog was dog aggressive, older than 6, hated children, or was 12 weeks old.  I looked 
                        on pet finder, and craigslist, and rescues, and everywhere I could think of to look. While looking, 
                        my best friend actually fell in love with a dog that I had found. He was a 4 or 5-month-old black 
                        puppy named Biscotti. I went with her to the <a href="http://hsmo.org/">humane society</a> to look at him but it said he was 
                        unavailable on his door. She went to find out why he was unavailable when online showed him available 
                        and get information on him. I walked around looking at the other dogs while I waited, there was some 
                        really cute ones but none that I thought would be a good match on Biscotti&#8217s row. I went to the next 
                        row and started down it.</p>

                    <h3>Love at first sight</h3> 
                    <p> Halfway down the next row, I stopped dead in my tracks. His picture on his door was so adorable and 
                        his name was Boots. What a horrid name I thought, that&#8217s a cat&#8217s name! I looked in the pin and he looked 
                        so lonely. I fed him few pieces of dog food out of the little box on the wall and he was so gentle. He 
                        didn&#8217t look how I imagined my perfect dog would, and he was a boy. I took out his information and read 
                        that he wasn&#8217t potty trained, was only 6 or 7 months old, and had been given up by his family, who had 
                        abused him.  I decided right there that he needed to come home with me. Dani came up to me and said that 
                        Biscotti was sick and that&#8217s why he was unavailable so he couldn&#8217t be adopted until he wasn&#8217t sick for 
                        24 hours. I told her about Boots and ended up adopting him and bringing him home that day. <img class="move" src="pictures/adoptionday.jpg" width="300px" height="400px" alt="Bentley and me"> </p>

                    <h3>New name for a new life</h3> 
                    <p> Luckily, he didn&#8217t know his name. I looked up boy names that started with the letter B thinking that it 
                        would help him progress to a new name more easily. I said a few differently boy names out loud, testing 
                        them out but he just ignored me and continued to play with Cali. "Bentley. Oh, that&#8217s cute," I said out 
                        loud. Boots stopped playing and looked at me. I waited for him to start playing again and said the name 
                        out loud again, "Bentley". He stopped playing and looked at me again. I said another name and he 
                        continued to play. I said Bentley a third time and he came over to me. So, he went from Boots to Bentley. 
                        Bentley Thomas more specifically, everyone needs a middle name. Two days after I adopted Bentley, Dani 
                        went back to the shelter and adopted Biscotti. In two days we went from three humans and one dog, to 
                        three humans and three dogs. Luckily with all three of our work schedules, the dogs were almost never 
                        alone. Biscotti and Bentley were instant best friends and still are to this day when we get them 
                        together, since we have our house and dont live with them any longer. <img src="pictures/three_dogs.jpg" width="400px" height="300px" alt="Bentley with cali and biscotti"></p>
