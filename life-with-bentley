                    <p>Bentley <strong>loves</strong> every human he meets. <em>Especially</em> kids. He hasn't been around a whole lot of other 
                    dogs but has gotten along well with the ones that he has been around, probably because he is so 
                    submissive. Except one 10lb female poodle mix that he was <strong><em>terrified</em></strong> of. He has also been introduced 
                    and done well with a hedgehog and a ball python. He was introduced to a chinchilla also, he didn't 
                    like her very much, my guess is that it reminded him of squirels. Squirels and rabbits are pretty 
                    much the only animals that bentley thinks hes bigger and stronger than. He is a little delusional 
                    about his size.  </p>

                    <p> Saying Bentley is delusional about his size is <em>probably</em> an understatement. He is terrified of the most
                    ridiculous things. We are working on his fears and have came a long way. Below is a list of just some of his 
                    weirdest and funniest fears: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>his reflection in mirrors, windows, doors, and the oven</li>
                            <li>his shadow</li>
                            <li>the dark</li>
                            <li>a plastic owl I have</li>
                            <li>a cowboy hat on the back of my bedroom door</li>
                            <li>occasionaly, small dogs</li>
                            <li>the printer</li>
                            <li>mops, brooms, vaccums, and dusters</li>
                            <li>boxes and plastic bags</li>
                            <li>his raised bed (he has conquered this fear thankfully)</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3 class="one">He's a goofball</h3> 
                    <p>Bentley is quirky like his mom. He does some weird things, I wont lie. He licks everything from the 
                    the floor and windows to his bed to his toys. He has licked everything since I got him. I talked to a 
                    trainer and doctor and was told he just has a weird habit of licking. He is a silly boy but I wouldnt 
                    trade or change him for anything. </p>

                    Everyone spoils their dogs, and all dogs who are loved are spoiled atleast a little I'm sure. But 
                    Bentley is extra spoiled. He has his own bedroom and closet, 4 toy boxes overflowing with toys, 4 beds, 
                    and he has more clothes than I do probably. He loves clothes and throws temper tantrums when I try to 
                    take them off of him. He is a tad ridiculous. He has sweaters, shirts, pants, jackets, socks, bowties, 
                    and pjs. <img src="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1682844641742577&set=a.710318552328529.1073741825.100000511736907&type=3&size=1440%2C1048">
